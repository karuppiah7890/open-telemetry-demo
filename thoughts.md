# Thoughts

These are the thoughts and my experiences while building
this demo.

I started off with a simple golang web server. I didn't
want to import the big web frameworks / libraries like
gin, fasthttp etc.

Just plain http.

Added a ping endpoint. It will respond to all kind of request methods
actually ðŸ˜… and can also take request bodies but of course it's not going to
read them or anything. Standard plain text response always. that's it.

I'm not really adding any tests here. I want to keep it simple. And no tests
really. I'm okay with it. I have noticed myself overdoing testing, so I'll have
to learn better and then come back to do better testing if I really want to do
it ðŸ˜…

Nex is the Fibonacci endpoint. It will take only `POST` requests and will read
from the request body and respond to it. O.o I'm afraid I might need some tests.
Anyways. Meh :P Let's see. I'll try to keep it too simple. I just want to see
a working demo. Not gonna go crazy about robustness in this case :)

So I built the fibonacci service to reply for the numbers 0 and 1 as they are
easy! So, this is how it currently looks like!

don't know the answer :p
```

And for another too, same

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/fibonacci -d '{ "sequenceNumber": 10 }'
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Date: Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:39:04 GMT
Content-Length: 25

don't know the answer :p
```

So, for `0` and `1` it works now. Gotta make it work for others!
